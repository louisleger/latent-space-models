# latent-space-models
The core aim of this project is to construct an optimal latent space for cell cycle and the circadian clock states using the live imaging data. The goal is therefore to develop and apply autoencoder models to process the live imaging data, with the goal of accurately identifying the underlying phases of the cell-cycle and the circadian clock.
